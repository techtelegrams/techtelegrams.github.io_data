MobilePhone is a Fabulous Tool invented for and by Human Mankind in this Planet.
It helps us to send and receive data (voice or text) to our dears and nears
instantly. And we can even get any information (news, entertainment,
etc) instantly. And it is very handy to carry with us 24/7. And it makes
to do anything instantly
- Something for our Profession (checking emails, learning etc)
- Something for our dears (interacting with our dears)
- Get to know about happening things (Reading news)
- Raising urgent emergency request

Nice to feel that right, in a history of Hundred Thousand years of Human Mankind
in this Planet, now we invented a Device (that is MobilePhone) which will never 
going to leave Humans hand even for a single day. All other devices will 
not be used by Humans every day or they might transform to an another device.
But this Mobile Phone is not going to replaced by any other device in this
Planet.

At the sametime of feeling Proud for the Mobile Phone invention, **it is one of
the worst invented device which makes
Human to addict for wasting time 24/7**. Even if some disciplined person
stays away from that MobilePhone Addiction, Spam Promotional Calls does the
elegant job of distraction. This reduces productivity of every Humans in this
Planet.

## Google's new Verified Call Feature
Yes even now there is no foolproof solution to identify and unpick the
Business Promotional Calls (Spam Calls). Now Google is bringing an improved
solution
[Verified Calls](https://support.google.com/phoneapp/answer/9794513)
for identifying Spam Calls and skip it in productive time. To notify Spam Calls
to receiver, Verified Calls feature on Phone App performs the task of
- Sending Business Caller's Identify to receiver
- Displaying Business Caller's reason for calling to receiver
- And Displaying Business logo.

All these things Google can do only if Business entity shares these informations
to Google on prior to making Calls. By viewing these 3 information, a receiver
can easily avoid picking up the Spam Calls. Especially it helps to identify
Spam Calls from a Business entity on which we are expecting a Call for some
other valid requested service. Thats one of the highlight in this feature.

Some of the Unethical Business entity may not share this details to Google,
so that they can breach into more customer for their product or service
Promotions. But this kind of Unethical Business entity will regularized
only if Governing body enforces every business should
share this information to Google or some other OS/APP developers while
making any Business Calls.

## Will Google cleans Verifed Call's data immediately ?
Again **I hope Google will provide data cleanup option to users for these
informations** immediately after the Call. As similar to current Location
history cleanup option in Google accounts.
